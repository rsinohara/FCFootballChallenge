A football game simulation challenge

To run, you must have npm installed (you can do it from https://nodejs.org/en/).

Once you do, navigate to the folder where you downloaded this repository.

Then install Mocha and Chai:
npm install mocha --save
npm install chai --save

Then you can do 'npm start' to see a game simulation
And 'npm test' to check everything is working as it should.
